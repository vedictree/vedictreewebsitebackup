                        <p>Pre-pandemic it was sole responsibility of teachers and school to handle child growth and learning but 
                        post pandemic it is a joint responsibility of teacher and parents, so that child’s overall growth and 
                        development happens smoothly.  An online class for preschoolers is a new learning environment for all of us 
                        and children are no exception. They will take some time to settle, so some parental support is required in
                        the early period. We have seen that at Vedic Tree, children settle in 1-2 weeks. Beyond this, friend, 
                        motivator, and coach are the three big roles that you, as a parent, need to fulfill. Create positivity 
                        around the online preschool, create a learning space at home, and motivate the child to attend the online 
                        classes every day. Take some time and provide help to the child wherever required. It's a great time to be 
                        a partner in your child's learning journey! Don't worry, we are with you. Together we will help your child 
                        to continue her learning.</p>

                        <p>Even in physical school kids do cry for some initial days after that they get used to it. Similarly it 
                        can be challenging for the kids and parents, we accept that. Our teachers have combined experience of
                        running more than 5000 hours of online preschool classes. We have seen kids settling down and becoming 
                        comfortable with online learning within a couple of weeks. At the beginning of the online preschool, we 
                        spend considerable time on the bonding activities which help kids settle faster. For example:</p>
                        <ol style="color: #8f9093;margin: 1em 0;font-size: 18px;">
                            <li>Fun singing session- Children love to sing. Singing in the group brings them closer and creates stronger bonds.</li>
                            <li>Games like getting to know each other- Child get the opportunity to share their likes and dislikes without any hesitation.</li>
                            <li>Puppet show- It's an instant hit with the children. They see the characters moving on the screen with the human voice. It brings the imagination into reality.</li>
                            <li>Scribbling and drawing time- we give children the freedom to express their thoughts and wishes through their scribbles and drawings. It helps to relax and calm down.</li>
                            <li>Through various activities, we create an environment of respect where each one is heard. Children feel comfortable and confident to share what they think without any fear! We create a classroom culture that encourages children to join and participate in the class.</li>

                        <p>Everything has its positives and negatives. We understand that too much screen time is not good for

                        screen time. Moreover, all our content is also available on the Vedic Tree App which you can refer to 
                        teach your child. Also, a classroom experience built by the teacher (even if it is online) goes a long 
                        way in a child's learning. Meeting friends regularly adds to the overall excitement as well as experience. 
                        As we move ahead, our early childhood education experts will help you to create constructive screen time 
                        for your child.</p>
