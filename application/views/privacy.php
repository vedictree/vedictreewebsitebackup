                        We provide information to students and parents by way of digital or electronic communication such as email, mobile, SMS, phone call and postal mail.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-delay=".5s">
                        We collect the information to provide the progress, improvement and other information about the student’s matters related to their schooling. 
                        We also use both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information when evaluating ways to improve the Website and the Service. As further described below, 
                        in limited circumstances we may disclose collected information, including Personal Information, to certain third parties in connection with providing Services 
                        or as required by law. We will not use or disclose collected information in ways different from what is described in this policy unless otherwise required by law.
                        We also use information collected through the Website and the Service to communicate with Registered Users from whom such information was collected in order to 
                        provide promotional materials about us. However, unlike communications which are necessary to provide Services ("Necessary Communications"), promotional 
                        communications are optional ("Optional Communications"), and Company will refrain from sending that kind of information to you if you inform us that you prefer 
                        not to receive them, as described in more detail below. Company uses Non-Personal Information in a variety of ways, including, by way of example, to evaluate the 
                        performance of the Website and Service and the general preferences of users, or to generate anonymous statistics for our benefit or for our business partners. 
                        Because Non-Personal Information is entirely anonymous, and therefore can never be used by us to identify you, this policy does not limit our ability to use or 
                        disclose Non-Personal Information. We may create Non-Personal Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that 
                        makes the data personally identifiable to you. If we collect information through the Website and/or the Service that you provide to us voluntarily through online 
                        forms or surveys, through e-mail communications or by other means, we will treat that information as described above, as applied to both Personal Information 
                        and Non-Personal Information. As a necessary part of providing Services, we may disclose information collected from you as described in this policy. 
                        For example, we may disclose certain Personal Information about you to our third-party service providers (e.g., our third party payment processors), as long as 
                        they are only using the Personal Information to provide services to us. If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, that company will 
                        possess the Personal Information collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this 
                        Privacy Policy. Under certain limited circumstances, we may cooperate with legal investigations and/or we may be subject to legal requirements to disclose 
                        information collected through the Website or Services, such as, by way of example, to a court or a governmental agency, and our policy is to provide such 
                        cooperation and comply fully with all such legal requirements. We may also disclose Personal Information to protect or defend the rights or property of Company 
                        or users of the Services and/or to investigate any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or terms and conditions. The disclosures 
                        contemplated by this paragraph ("Necessary Disclosures") are necessary if you wish to use the Service. As mentioned above, Company may use and disclose 
                        Non-Personal Information without restriction. If you do not want us to make such Necessary Disclosures, or to use Non-Personal Information without restriction, 
                        you must not use the Service. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Site. These companies may use information 
                        (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about 
                        goods and services of interest to you.
