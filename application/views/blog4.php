                                    A nursery and a playgroup are very similar to each other in structure. The difference is in their style of education. Nursery is a bit more formal, while playgroups are more 
                                    casual in their approach. Nursery is the broader term under which playgroup falls while playgroup is an informal nursery. The nursery means to nurse a child and take care of 
                                    it whereas playgroup means separating a number of children into small groups and encouraging them to play among these groups.
